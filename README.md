###### Docker image on Alpine Linux with Google SDK and AWS CLI

#### Setup

Create or select a GCP service account with an appropriate role granted for access to GCP resources as you see fit. Save the credential `.json`

Create an IAM user in AWS with an appropriate role granted for access to AWS resources as you see fit. Record the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and the AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY. Use these to create a script file '<your-script-name>.sh' copying the example below.

Copy the GCP service account credential file, named `svc_account.json` into the directory you're running this container from.
The GCP service account authorization happens at runtime in the `docker_entrypoint.sh` script.

Put your AWS auth script into the directory you're running this container from, named `<your-script-name>.sh`, 
and execute it with: 

```
. <your-script-name>.sh
```
This adds a `cloudtools` alias into the shell which authorises with AWS using the key pair exported as environment variables in the auth script. Calls can then be issued to any GCP or AWS command as follows. 


#### Usage examples

```
cloudtools gsutil ls --help
```
```
cloudtools aws s3 ls 
```
```
cloudtools gcloud auth list
```

#### Example AWS auth and alias script
```
#!/bin/bash
export AWSREGION=<your AWS region of choice>
export AWSACCESSKEYID=<your AWS access key ID>
export AWSSECRETACCESSKEY=<your AWS secret access key>
alias cloudtools="docker run -it --rm -e AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=$AWSREGION -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$AWSACCESSKEYID -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$AWSSECRETACCESSKEY -v $(pwd):/tmp/certs bengordonfraser/cloudtools:latest"
```
